# Critical-Temperature-for-Superconductivity
I would like to model the critical temperature of different materials by using their physical properties  like number_of_elements mean_atomic_mass wtd_mean_atomic_mass and more. Superconductivity is the property when direct current passes through a conductive material without loss in energy (zero resistance) below a  critical temperature.
